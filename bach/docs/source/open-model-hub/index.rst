Open model hub
==============
The open model hub is a toolkit that contains functions and models that can be applied on data collected with 
Objectivâ€™s Tracker. There are three types of functions/models: 
1. Helper functions. These helper functions simplify manipulating and analyzing the data. 
2. Aggregation models. These models consist of a combination of Bach instructions that run some of the more common data analyses or product analytics metrics. 
3. Machine learning models.

All models are open-source, free to use, and can be combined to build advanced compound models with little effort.

If you want to use the open model hub, install the package from PyPI as follows:

.. code-block:: console

    pip install objectiv-modelhub


See the :ref:`example notebooks <example_notebooks>` section to get started immediately. 

View the list of available models :ref:`here <models>` or check out the full
:ref:`open model hub API reference <open_model_hub_api_reference>`. 

More information on setting up a development environment for the open model hub and how to configure Metabase 
is in the `readme <https://github.com/objectiv/objectiv-analytics/tree/main/modelhub>`_.


The open model hub is powered by :ref:`Bach <bach>`: Objectiv's data modeling library. With Bach, you can 
compose models with familiar Pandas-like dataframe operations in your notebook. It uses a SQL abstraction 
layer that enables models to run on the full dataset, and you can output models to SQL with a single command. 
Head over to the :ref:`Bach <bach>` section to learn all about it.

**BigQuery Tips**

The columns in Bach DataFrame are the database columns, hence the column name must contain only letters (`a-z`, `A-Z`), numbers (`0-9`), or underscores (`_`), and it must start with a letter or underscore. Especially remember this during [`DataFrame.unstack()`](/modeling/bach/api-reference/DataFrame/bach.DataFrame.unstack.mdx) usage.

If you are planning to do a lot of operations on a given Bach DataFrame and already the underlying SQL query is complex it would be more optimal for the database first to materialize the current DataFrame as a temporary table:

.. code-block:: console

    df = df.materialize(materialization='your_temp_table_name')

and then continue to do all the other complex operations. One way of checking SQL complexity:

.. code-block:: console

    display_sql_as_markdown(df)


.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 7
    :hidden:
    
    version-check
    API reference <api-reference/index>
