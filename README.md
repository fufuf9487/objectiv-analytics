Objectiv is self-hosted. It includes what you need to answer common product & marketing questions fast and accurately, while
providing a solid foundation for advanced model building and in-depth analysis.


## Highlights
* Run your entire product analytics workflow straight from your notebook
* Collect model-ready data without tracking plans, data cleaning or transformations
* Take pre-built models off the shelf to build in-depth analyses in minutes
* Get granular slicing control with data that carries the structure of your product's UI
* Build models on the full SQL dataset with dataframes and pandas-like operations
* Output models to SQL with one command and feed it into your tools and products

| *Use pre-built models and [pandas-like operations](https://www.objectiv.io/docs/modeling/) that run on the full dataset as SQL.* |

## The open analytics taxonomy

Objectiv's tracker validates all incoming events against an [open analytics taxonomy](https://www.objectiv.io/docs/taxonomy/). This eliminates the need for a tracking plan and ensures a highly consistent dataset that's ready for modeling without cleaning & transformation. As a result, models and datasets are intercompatible and can be shared and reused.
